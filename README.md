# Basketball Player Portfolio

Hey there! This is a professional basketball portfolio showcasing my journey, skills, and achievements in basketball. This site demonstrates my career progression from high school through college to amateur leagues, highlighting my stats, achievements, and basketball capabilities.

This is written in Typescript using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), as a SSG tool. It utilizes [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as well as  [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations.

This contains details about my basketball career, including statistics, achievements, training background, and game highlights. 

Site is Currently deployed at <b>Netlify</b>'s Free tier .

## Local Development

This is just a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Please use atleast Node v12, but the recommended version is Node v14 LTS. There's a `.nvmrc`, you can run `nvm use` if you have nvm installed.

## Getting Started

This project heavily favors <b>yarn</b> over npm. 

So to set things up you need to run

```bash
yarn install
```
or just
```bash
yarn
```

Then to run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

and it should open at

> http://localhost:3000/


## Deployment

Nothing special, its setup at Netlify end (in other words: no `netlify.toml`), just merge a feat branch to master branch and you're good.
